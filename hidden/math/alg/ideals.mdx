### Ideal numbers

Ideals have the peculiarity that they were introduced for a completely different reason than they're used today. It's definition is so simple that they can be easily introduced without even mentioning their first motivation. Just because that's the case on every other notes, I found it interesting to try to introduce them the same way they were initially conceived. Of course, I think that this is neither a better nor worse approach to the topic, is just different.

We might first understand Kummer's idea to "solve" the problem. For that, let's take the factorization:

$$
6 = 2\times 3 = (1 - \sqrt{-5}) (1 + \sqrt{-5})
$$
