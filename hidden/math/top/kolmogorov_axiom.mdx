We now study an axiom which is strictly weaker than the Hausdorff axiom.

<Definition title='Kolmogorov'>
Let $X$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ satisfies the **Kolmogorov axiom** (also called the $T_0$ axiom) if for every $x, y\in X$ there is an open set $U$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\not\in U$ or $x\not\in U$ and $y\in U$.
</Definition>

It is remarkable that all spaces satisfying this axiom can be characterized in a very specific way.
