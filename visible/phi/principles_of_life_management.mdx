## A day is 24 hours long

I think this maxim is the ruling principle of productivity & life management. 

We want to maximize ROTI given a fixed time window.

## Thought stream

Our thought stream has a great disadvantage: it follows a [depth-first search](dfs) path over our mind. This is because when we have some thought in our mind, we are far more likely to hop to a related topic than to some unrelated thing we've had in our mind four thoughts ago.

Of course, if we want to maximize the [return of time](roti.md) we must first optimize how we invest thinking time. Thus, we might first be able to prioritize the tasks one needs to concentrate on (this corresponds to a [Dijkstra](dijkstra) traversal). And the most probable scenario is that the priority order does not coincide with a simple DFS order, i.e., when we let our mind wander we will probably spend a lot of time on things we actually don't value that much.

My current workflow to overcome is using an adaptation of the [GTD](gtd.md) inbox tray. Essentially, everything that catches my eye but does not deserve immediate attention goes to the inbox tray. Currently, I only possess physical "INBOX" tray and plenty of paper cards to scribble down my ideas. Every night I go though the inbox and triage the topic accordingly. Ideally, I imagine that the inbox should be more versatile in the sense of being able to capture everything: incoming emails, messages, websites, thoughts, etc.
