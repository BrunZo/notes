I named the note "Principles" in order to avoid the more pretentious title "Principles of life", despite its purpose is more clearly stated by the latter name.

## A day is 24 hours long
I think this maxim is the ruling principle of both daily productivity & life designing. The latter might be more acurrately represented by the analogous claim that "life is, at best, roughly 90 years long".

There're some easy theorems we can deduce from those assertions:
- Optimizing the return, given that the time window is fixed, is equivalent to optimizing the return of time invested.
- In order to optimize the return, we must take decisions (as time is finite). Thus, optimizing the return entails taking the "right" decisions.

## Global vs. local phenomenon
The global vs. local phenomenon is one of the first problems we need to sort in life optimization (as well as in any other optimization problem).

See <Zettel.global_local mode="link" /> for an in-depth discussion.

You can also check the note on <Zettel.simulated_annealing mode="link" />.

## Metrics
In order to become better at any activity, you _must_ record metrics about how you're performing in it. 
E.g., if you want to become better at time manamgent, you must know how do you spend your time so that you can both measure progress and also identify weak areas.
Thus, a personal development framework must include relevant metrics which track things like quality of life, return, utility, etc.
