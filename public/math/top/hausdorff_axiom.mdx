Our current definition of topological space has some drawbacks. There're some "intuitive" facts that do not hold anymore for arbitrary topological spaces:

1. A singleton $\{x\}$ does not need to be a closed subset.

2. A sequence $(x_n)_{n\ge 1}$ can have more than one limit.

(Prove that if every sequence has a unique limit then the set $\{x\}$ must be closed.)

There is an additional axiom which allows us to prove the previous two facts for every topological space that satisfies it.

<Definition title='Hausdorff axiom'>
Let $X$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ satisfies the **Hausdorff axiom** (also called the $T_2$ axiom) if for every $x, y\in X$ there're open sets $U$, $V$ such that $x\in U$, $y\in V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$.
