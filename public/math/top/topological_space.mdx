Let $X$ be a set. A **topology** over $X$ is some subset $\tau\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that:

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ belong to $\tau$.
2. Arbitrary union of elements of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.
3. Intersection of two elements of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.

A **topological space** is a set $X$ endowed with some specific topology $\tau$.
