<Definition title='Initial topologies'>
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a map. Suppose $Y$ is endowed with some topology. We define the **initial topology** on $X$ with respect to $f$ as
$$
\tau = \{f^{-1}(U)\mid U\in \tau\}
$$
This is, the coarsest topology on $X$ such that the map $f\colon X\to Y$ is continuous.

We can suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are already topological spaces and ask ourselves which conditions on $f$ guarantee that the map $f\colon X\to Y$ is "initial", i.e., $X$ has the initial topology. By definition, if there're some $x_1, x_2\in X$ s.t. $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ then the open neighborhoods of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are exactly the same. Thus, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are topologically indistinguishable (see <Zettel.kolmogorov_axiom mode='link'/>). Thus, we can "collapse" the topologically equivalent points in the domain and get an initial and injective function $f$. Being initial thus becomes equivalent to the fact that $f$ is a homeomorphism of $X$ and $f(X)$, which is usually called being an embedding.

<Definition title='Embeddings'>
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a continuous map between topological spaces. We say that $f$ is an embedding, or, equivalently, that $X$ is an (embedded) subspace of $Y$, if $F: X\to Y$ is an homeomorphism between $X$ and $f(X)$. Equivalently, a map $f$ is an embedding if and only if $f$ is injective and $X$ has the initial topology with respect to $f$.

For example, let us consider the map $f: [0, 1)\to \R^2$ given by $f(t) = (\cos{2\pi t}, \sin{2\pi t})$. If we take the usual topology if $[0, 1]$, then this map is not an embedding since the open set $[0, \varepsilon)\subseteq [0, 1)$ cannot be the preimage of any open set in $\R^2$. This occurs as $[0, 1)$ is definitely not homeomorphic to the subspace $S^1\subseteq \R^2$.

If we take the mapping $f(t) = (\cos{\pi t}, \sin{\pi t})$ instead, this function is an embedding, as a semicircumference is homeomorphic to a segment.

Otherwise, we could instead choose the initial topology on $[0, 1)$ given by the former mapping. With this topology $[0, \varepsilon)$ is not an open set, as in fact every neighborhood of $0$ must contain $1-\varepsilon$ for some $\varepsilon$. This is like giving the "$S^1$ topology" to the semiopen interval, which entails "gluing" the endpoints together.
